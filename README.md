# Custom Canny Edge Detector with BFS-Based Strong Edge Recognition

This repository features a custom implementation of the Canny Edge Detection algorithm using Python and NumPy, with a unique approach that leverages BFS during strong edge detection. The BFS-based method dynamically identifies and links strong and weak edges in real-time, resulting in more efficient performance and reduced false positives.

### Key Features:
- **Integrated Edge Detection & Linking**: Combines edge detection and linking in a single BFS traversal.
- **Adaptive Thresholding**: Dynamically classifies strong and weak edges based on local connectivity.
- **Performance**: Achieves faster runtime compared to other Python implementations.

Explore the code and run the tests to see how BFS can enhance Canny edge detection!
