# custom-canny-edge-detector

A custom implementation of the Canny Edge Detection algorithm using Python and NumPy. This project includes Gaussian smoothing, gradient calculation with Sobel filters, non-maxima suppression, and edge linking using BFS while doing the non-maxima suppression is the unique point of the code.
